    "### Detecting entries for ISSN/eISSN with no records [FAILED]\n",
    "\n",
    "I **Curated results and added DOI prefix/root**. Below, I am trying to detect records that match these prefix hoping to be able to find missing records. The problem is that the prefix can be used by a whole editor (let's say a university) and this can be tricky, since is hard to establish a relation to the specific journal. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Search for journal records in DOAJ database using DOI prefixes as an alternative identification method for journals that may not have standardized ISSN indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Journals:**\n",
    "- Ciencia y Tecnologia de Buques (10.25043/)\n",
    "- Ingenieria e Innovacion (10.21897/)\n",
    "- Informe Economico (10.26694/)\n",
    "- Revista Colombiana de Contabilidad (10.56241/)\n",
    "- Accounting and Management Research (10.22209/)\n",
    "- Revista Economia y Politica (10.25097/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search Methodology:**\n",
    "1. **Text-based search**: Fast string matching across all 95 DOAJ batch files\n",
    "2. **JSON parsing**: Detailed record extraction when prefix matches are found\n",
    "3. **DOI validation**: Extract specific DOI identifiers from matched records\n",
    "4. **Full record extraction**: Complete scan to capture all matching records\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing Features:**\n",
    "- **Dual-stage search**: Combines fast text search with detailed JSON analysis\n",
    "- **Progress tracking**: Real-time processing feedback with tqdm progress bars\n",
    "- **Sample collection**: Stores representative records for manual validation\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of malformed JSON and missing files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Files:**\n",
    "- `doi_prefix_matched_records.jsonl` - All records matching DOI prefix patterns\n",
    "- Console summary with match statistics and journal-specific counts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **High false positive potential**: DOI prefixes may capture unrelated publications from same publisher\n",
    "- **Broad scope**: Publisher-level prefixes rather than journal-specific identifiers\n",
    "- **Quality concerns**: Requires manual validation to ensure records belong to target journals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Application:** Designed as supplementary method for journals with inconsistent ISSN indexing, though analysis showed prefix matching was too broad for reliable journal identification. Script demonstrates alternative approaches for bibliographic record"

    "## Quering Batches and Extracting Records (based on EISSN/ISSN) for Engineering / Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Extract registries/records from the DOAJ database (2024 update) for journals in economics and engineering disciplines based on ISSN/EISSN matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Files:**\n",
    "- `economics_journal_ids.csv` or `engineering_journal_ids.csv` (TSV format with columns: Journal_title, ISSN, EISSN)\n",
    "- 95 DOAJ batch files: `article_batch_1.json` to `article_batch_95.json` (JSON array format, ~100,000 records each)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing Workflow:**\n",
    "1. **Target Loading**: Load journal ISSNs from TSV input file with tab delimiter handling\n",
    "2. **Batch Processing**: Process all 95 JSON array files with progress tracking via tqdm\n",
    "3. **ISSN Extraction**: Extract ISSNs from multiple BibJSON locations (identifier arrays, journal.issns)\n",
    "4. **Record Matching**: Match DOAJ records against target ISSN list using set intersection\n",
    "5. **Validation**: Calculate journal title similarity scores for quality assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Files:**\n",
    "- `filtered_[discipline]_records.jsonl` - All matching registries/records in JSONL format\n",
    "- `validation_report_[discipline].csv` - Structured validation data with similarity scores\n",
    "- `validation_report_[discipline].txt` - Human-readable summary with flagged low-similarity matches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Robust ISSN parsing**: Handles multiple identifier formats and locations within BibJSON structure\n",
    "- **Memory-efficient processing**: Loads entire JSON arrays per file (~9.5M total records processed)\n",
    "- **Quality validation**: Flags records with low journal title similarity (<60%) for manual review\n",
    "- **Progress monitoring**: Real-time processing feedback with file-by-file match counts\n",
    "- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing files and malformed JSON data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality Assurance:**\n",
    "- Cross-validates ISSN matches with journal titles using string similarity algorithms\n",
    "- Maintains provenance tracking with record IDs and source file information\n",
    "- Generates validation reports to identify potential data quality issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:** Processes ~9.5 million registries/records across 95 batch files in approximately 4-5 minutes with comprehensive error logging and match reporting."

    "\n",
    " JSONL ====> TSV Converter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Convert filtered DOAJ records from JSONL format to tab-separated TSV files suitable for analysis and data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Files:**\n",
    "- `filtered_engineering_records.jsonl` - Engineering discipline records\n",
    "- `filtered_economics_records.jsonl` - Economics discipline records\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Files:**\n",
    "- `filtered_engineering_records.tsv` - Engineering records in TSV format\n",
    "- `filtered_economics_records.tsv` - Economics records in TSV format\n",
    "\n",
    "**TSV Format Specifications:**\n",
    "- Field separator: Tab characters (no quotes around text fields)\n",
    "- Text encoding: UTF-8 (preserves accents and special characters)\n",
    "- Multiple values: Separated by `***` (e.g., multiple authors, keywords, subjects)\n",
    "- Missing data: Labeled as `N/A`\n",
    "- Variable names: Clean names without special characters for compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Data Fields Extracted:**\n",
    "- Author information (name, affiliation, ORCID ID)\n",
    "- Journal metadata (title, publisher, country, ISSNs, language)\n",
    "- Publication details (title, abstract, keywords, year)\n",
    "- Subject classification codes and terms\n",
    "- DOI and full-text links\n",
    "- **ISIpubdate**: Standardized publication year extracted from `bibjson.year` or `created_date`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Processing Features:**\n",
    "- Handles multiple authors/keywords/subjects in single columns\n",
    "- Text cleaning while preserving UTF-8 characters\n",
    "- Robust error handling for missing or malformed fields\n",
    "- Smart year extraction for temporal analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage:** Run script in directory containing JSONL files. Automatically processes both discipline files and generates corresponding TSV outputs for spreadsheet applications and statistical analysis tools."

    "**Purpose:** Checking DOIs and ISSN/EISSN to OPEN Alex. Analyze the coverage of filtered DOAJ records in the OpenAlex database to assess data completeness and identify potential gaps between the two scholarly databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input Files:**\n",
    "- `filtered_economics_records.jsonl` - Economics discipline records from DOAJ\n",
    "- `filtered_engineering_records.jsonl` - Engineering discipline records from DOAJ\n",
    "- `economics_journal_ids.csv` and `engineering_journal_ids.csv` - Target journal ISSNs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Methodology:**\n",
    "1. **DOI-based matching**: Primary matching of DOAJ records in OpenAlex using DOI identifiers\n",
    "2. **ISSN-based querying**: Retrieve all OpenAlex records for target journals (published before March 31, 2024)\n",
    "3. **Comparative analysis**: Calculate coverage metrics and identify gaps between databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coverage Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Record-level coverage**: Percentage of DOAJ records found in OpenAlex\n",
    "- **Journal-level coverage**: Percentage of target journals indexed in OpenAlex\n",
    "- **Missing records**: DOAJ records not indexed in OpenAlex\n",
    "- **Additional records**: OpenAlex records not present in DOAJ dataset\n",
    "- **Journal comparison**: Record count ratios between databases per journal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output Reports:**\n",
    "- **Text report**: Human-readable coverage analysis with detailed breakdowns by discipline\n",
    "- **CSV report**: Structured data with coverage statistics for further analysis\n",
    "- **Timestamped files**: Version-controlled output for reproducible research\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Usage:**\n",
    "- Responsible querying of OpenAlex API with rate limiting and proper attribution\n",
    "- Email contact provided for API usage transparency\n",
    "- Request counting and error handling for reliable data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Value:** Identifies complementarity between DO\n"
