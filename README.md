# Repository supporting the paper "Epistemic Diversity in other-than-English Contexts"

## Overview

This repository supports a paper presented in the 2025 edition of the Conference for the Society of Social Studies of Science (4S), see the complete citation below. The latest copy of the paper, upon request, is still a work in progress; therefore, no preprint is available yet. Overall, the paper performs critical data work, resorting to different resources connected to specific pieces of open infrastructure. By looking closely at these systems, it pays to use this understanding to work with the data exhaust of the processes that help support open-access journals' indexing processes. In a nutshell, it detects and parses different metadata sources to build a list of active OJS installations in Latin America indexed in DOAJ (Khanna et al., 2022; Raoni, 2024; DOAJ, 2024).

## Key Objectives (of the paper)
1. Explore the role of sciences as critical mediators of globality
2. Analyze knowledge circulation and prestige allocation in alternative publishing streams
3. Investigate the ecological effects of open infrastructure on scientific diversity

## Methodology
The paper compares two different datasets: 
1. Spanish-based Diamond Open Access Journals: DOAJ + OJS. 
2. English-based Paywalled + APC-based Journals.

This script supports the data work on the article metadata, with a focus on the point 1. 

### Data Sources
- Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) article metadata (DOAJ, 2024)
- Open Journal System (OJS) Beacon Data (Khanna et al., 2022; Raoni, 2024)

### Data Work / Focus

The script shows the process performed to focus on two disciplines within the bra
- Economics
- Engineering

### Key Findings
#### Semantic Landscape Differences
- Spanish publications show:
  - More cross-topic integration
  - Greater emphasis on local problems and context
  - Closer interconnection between research topics

- English publications demonstrate:
  - More specialized, detailed lexical structures
  - Stronger emphasis on technical expertise
  - More fragmented topic connections

## Significance
The research highlights:
- The critical role of open infrastructures in supporting epistemic diversity
- Alternative knowledge circulation practices in Latin America
- Challenges to monopolistic knowledge production models
